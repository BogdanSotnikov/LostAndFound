INITIAL DD REVIEW
* SUMMARY OF PEER REVIEW:
    - Suggestions were given regarding way we should do things as well as comments about our organization of
	data. The following comments/suggestions were deemed the most useful, followed by our solution:
		- Site map included a USERS box which would lead to confusion (team deck) -- should delete for clarity
		- SQLite does not allow for the storage of lists within tables (team deck) -- will be changed to strings that
		are then split at commas
		- Specific comments about what was wrong during login process would pose security issue (team carrots) -- will
		combine username and password message
		- Logout page could be omitted (team carrots) -- this page will instead be considered as something 'extra',
		done after MVP as produced
		- Maintain navbar consistency along with any intentional differences (team carrots) -- duly noted
		- Site map should include specification of authentication prereqs regarding access to pages such as the login
		page (team carrots) -- will attempt to make site map more clear, either with comments or better arrow placements
	- In addition to these suggestions, we had received compliments in regards to any potential extra features as well as
	thorough explanations.
